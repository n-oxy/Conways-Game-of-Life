# Conway's Game of Life
A [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) by [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) envisioned in a C++ executable.
This software was created at like 3 AM, and I very much so rushed it.

# Rules Applied
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

'x' = live cell,
'-' = dead cell
